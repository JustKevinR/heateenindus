# Setup:


## 1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## 2. Install the required libraries by running pip install selenium.

## 3. File Preparation:

  Prepare a text file named comments.txt containing the comments you want to post. Each comment should be on a separate line.
  Ensure the text file is encoded in UTF-8 format.

## 4. Execution:

  Run the script using Python.
  Follow the instructions provided in the console.

## 5. Input Instructions:

  URL: Enter the URL of the website where you want to post comments.
  Number of Runs: Enter the number of times you want the script to run. You can also enter 'endless' for the script to run indefinitely.
  Cooldown Type: Choose between 'fixed' and 'realistic' for the cooldown period between runs.
  Cooldown Duration: If you choose 'fixed' cooldown type, enter the duration of the cooldown in minutes. If you choose 'realistic', you don't need to enter anything.

## 6. Execution:

  The script will launch the Microsoft Edge browser.
  It will open the specified URL and start posting comments from the comments.txt file.
  After posting each comment, it will wait for you to press Enter before closing the browser.

  If you have chosen 'endless' runs, the script will continue running indefinitely until you manually stop it.

## 7. Cooldown:

  If you have selected the 'fixed' cooldown type, the script will wait for the specified duration between each run.
  If you have selected the 'realistic' cooldown type, the script will wait for a random time between 15 minutes to 4 hours between each run.

## 8. Exit:

You can stop the script execution at any time by terminating the Python process.
